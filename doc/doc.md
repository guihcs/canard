A knowledge base is a tuple KB = hC, I, R, T, V, Ai, where C is a set of
classes, I a set of individuals, R a set of relations, T a set of datatypes, V a set of
values and A a set of axioms (formulae) between the entities from the before-listed
sets. A knowledge base is composed of a terminologic part (T box), called ontology
and an assertional part (Abox) called population.
The T box is hC, R, T, V, T (A)i and the Abox is hI, V, A \ T (A)i, where T (A) is
the set of axioms which define and describe the entities from C, R, T . V contains
the label values of the other entities; for this reason it is in both the T box and
Abox.
Table 2.1 shows syntax and semantics of DL expressions which will be used in
the remainder of this thesis. In the table, hI, Di is an interpretation in which I is
the interpretation function and D is the domain of interpretation.
